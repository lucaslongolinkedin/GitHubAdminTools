## LICENSE TYPE C: Copyleft Licenses

### Needs explicit approval. See Third Party IP (2c) above for further information.

Copyleft licensed packages may not be used without approval by Lil Github Team (LiL-Github-Team@linkedin.com).

Weak copyleft licenses generally require that the OSS source code, plus any modifications to the OSS code files, be made available under the same OSS license. They generally require some degree of reciprocity or other restriction on use. Strong copyleft licenses require that an OSS component, and modifications to it, remain under the copyleft license terms. The license requires products derived from the software to be licensed only under the terms of the copyleft license, which includes a requirement to make the source code to both the licensed materials and improvements available upon distribution. There is no “linking” to proprietary code allowed.
